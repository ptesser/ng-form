# Ng Form Utils

This library has been created to manage some Angular forms utilities.

Another scope of this repository is to understand how Angular allows to create NPM library.

## Build lib

In order to build a new version of the library you have to:

1. Update lib version
2. Run `npm build ng-form-utils`
3. `cd dist/ng-form-utils`
4. `npm publish`


## TODO

- [ ] Add script to automatically bump the version
- [ ] Test lib in some Angular application
- [ ] Improve service sharing
- [ ] Add test of `NgFormUtilsService`
